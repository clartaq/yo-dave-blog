There are two primary reasons that comments are not enabled on this site.

1.  These are just notes I write to myself. They don't get much attention other than when I want to remind myself of something. It wouldn't be fair to solicit comments and then just ignore them.
2.  Comment spam. Related to the above, I just don't check in often enough and would not effectively moderate and eliminate spam.

This does not mean that the site will never be opened up to comments. There are times when I would really like to get other opinions. It's just a matter of available attention at the moment.
