Many years ago, back in 2009, during an infrequent upgrade of my desktop computer, I finally bought an HD monitor, actually, slightly better than HD at a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels. My reaction was along the lines of "Ooooh! Pretty!". It was a big 27" unit. Easy to view, lots of screen real estate. Very clear text rendering.

I thought I was set forever.

Since then, I've purchased a few Apple products with Retina displays. The new 9.7" iPad Pro's for example. They look *so* much better.

As I've gotten used to the Retina displays over the past few years, when I use the HD monitor, it looks kinda fuzzy and shabby. I can't stand it. I have to get something better. Maybe a system with a 5K Apple display. Whenever I can afford or justify it. Progress just makes me spend more money.

(**Update 2018-03-10**: I recently replaced my Windows computer with a 5K iMac Pro. Oh, what a difference.)
