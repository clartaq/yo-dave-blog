I’ve been using Disqus to take care of the comments on this site. As of today, that is over.

The reason is simple. [Tracking](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/disqus-launches-advertising-2014-11). They plan to build very detailed user profiles based on the comments that people leave around the net. I didn’t know, but they were spying on the people who comment on my stuff. Without telling anyone.

That’s over.
