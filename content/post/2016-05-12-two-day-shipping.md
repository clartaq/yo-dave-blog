Is it just me or does it seem like the "FREE Two-Day Shipping" promised by [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) [Prime](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DBYBNEE?_encoding=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0) never actually occurs?

Sometimes I actually get things after one business day. But more often its three or four or five. Sometimes there's an excuse like "Extreme Weather Conditions". Sometimes things actually get here when promised.

If Amazon is paying extra for two day shipping, they are getting robbed.

Just sayin'.
