Often, when reading blogs, I am struck by the number of misspellings, incorrect word usages, bad grammar, and so on.

But the experience of transferring this blog from other systems to it's current home has been an eye opener. I proofread my posts, usually multiple times. However, in doing so I was struck by the number of misspellings, incorrect word usages, bad grammar, and so on.

I am humbled (in the [_real_](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/humbled) sense of the word.)
