Way back in 2014, I wrote a [post](https://clartaq.github.io/yo-dave/2014/10/14/2014-10-14a-is-my-hosting-service-a-scam/) asking whether my new hosting company, [CloudAtCost](http://cloudatcost.com/) was a scam. Back then, I concluded that they were not.

Fast forward to now, and it turns out they were a scam after all.

Back in June they started sending me notices about not having paid a fee for "Maintenance". They threatened to shut down and erase all my stuff at some unspecified time in the near future if I didn't pay up. Although the fee was small, it seemed like a violation of "free forever".  Since I didn't have much important stuff and their service has always been crappy, I let it slide.

No more throwing good money after bad.
