My wife and I just returned from a long cruise to Hawaii and back. During that time, we were just about completely disconnected from the mobile world -- no access to email, cell phone, fax. There was sporadic television available.

On balance I didn't miss it too much. I continued to work on problems in my head, looking forward to the chance to get back to work on them when we returned. That eagerness to return was almost exactly balanced by the dread of dealing with all the emails that would be waiting when we got back.

Still, a nice chance to step back and look at the world with fresh eyes.
