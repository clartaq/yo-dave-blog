Hi.

Welcome to my new blog.

This is just a place for me to vent about problems with technology. Despite the name of the blog, I’m a technologist myself. I’ve spent decades developing medical technology. It’s likely that every reader in the States (and probably beyond) has been touched by technology I have worked on.

Despite that, technology often fails us. I get to gripe about it here. My other blogs and web sites are all fact-based, but this one contains a lot of opinion.

I’m happy to hear other opinions too. I can be swayed by reason and evidence, so go ahead and tell me when I’m being an ignorant dufus.

Commentary on this site is expected to be polite. Name calling and other childish behavior will result in being banned.

Now that’s out of the way, let’s get started.
