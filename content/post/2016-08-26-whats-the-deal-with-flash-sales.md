We have some pretty amazing communications technology these days. One way we seem to be wasting it is on the phenomenon of "Flash Sales" -- offering items on sale for a very short time. That's all we need -- more advertising -- often for trivial discounts -- with deadline pressure.

I have never understood the allure of such things. It seems that people who have a "Fear of Missing Out" (FOMO) are most susceptible to this stuff.

Some "opportunities" aren't worth pursuing.
