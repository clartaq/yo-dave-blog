As noted in yesterday's blog, I'm making a sweep through my previous posts trying to fix links that have broken over the years. This is in preparation for switching to another blogging platform.

I find that the rot even creeps into the `README.md` files in my own code repositories. Many of them refer back to descriptions of the repositories posted to no longer existing versions of the blog.

I'll fix those as soon as I can.

In the meantime, I sincerely apologize to anyone that I have inflicted these broken links upon.
