As some of you know, we've spent the last several months moving around looking for a nice place to settle down. That's finished. We're now in Salem, Virginia.

Before starting that search, we bought a laptop to take over the duties of the desktop. On the night before we left Tucson, I dumped a cup of water on it and fried the keyboard and other parts. It turns out the model was too new to get replacement parts. And since we had just spent $1,400 on this thing, my wife wasn't about to let me buy another.

As a result, we've been using iPads for our computing needs with occasional jaunts to the library.

Oh my gosh! I thought I was going to die. Typing anything of any length on the iPad is horrible. Being back on the desktop with a keyboard is just so... good! I never want to go through that again.

(Still don't have the laptop repaired.)
