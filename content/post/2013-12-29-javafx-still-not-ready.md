Just a short rant about JavaFX because I'm pissed about it at the moment. I enjoy using it for the most part but it sometimes throws up surprising obstacles in otherwise routine work. The latest for me was an unexpected lack of a spinner control. There are alternatives in some open source projects, but, really? No spinners built in?

This is almost as gob-smacking weird as the lack of dialogs. (Ok, there are some dialogs, like for opening/saving files, but not much in the way of user-programmable dialogs built in.)

And don't get me started about the odd placement of the run time library. It seems to change with every few releases. Always having to put in some kludgy version-dependent stuff to find the libraries.

Maybe it will all be fixed in version 8.
