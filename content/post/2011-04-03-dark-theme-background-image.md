As has been noted before, Arizona contains enough photogenic scenery that even I get a nice photo now and then. Here's one that has been manipulated a bit into a nice abstract background for blogs or program windows.

This was taken at the Bryce-Thompson Arboretum in Florence Arizona in the Autumn of 2010\. The photo originated as a snapshot of a rock covered with a bluish-gray lichen and a rather bright green moss. Not sure how this stuff survives here - it didn't appear to be irrigated in any way and it was covering lots of different rocks.

Anyway, after a few simple manipulations in PhotoShop, I ended up with the image you see. Here's a smaller sized version:
