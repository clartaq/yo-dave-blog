I've been away awhile, working on a new project. It's part of an educational effort about molecular dynamics simulation. Although I've been working a lot with Clojure using emacs for editing, this project required a return to Java. As a result, I've been using NetBeans again. The difference in productivity was amazing and not in the way I expected.

As I said, I've been using Clojure and emacs for awhile now and was very pleased with the productivity gains that were possible with the Clojure language. However, to work with Clojure, I had been using emacs as the editor and development environment.

When I switched back to Java and NetBeans, it took longer to figure out how to do stuff, but my fingers just flew. That wasn't my experience with emacs. I would often have to pause to try to remember keystrokes. Sometimes, I would have to do some customization to the editor just to get things done more efficiently. Emacs is infinitely customizable, but you <em>need</em> to make those customizations. It just isn't that useful out of the box. And that is where I was spending a lot of my time. The expressive benefits of Clojure were being lost in the constant need to fiddle with emacs.

Sure, a lot of this can be made up with continued use a practice, but it wasn't what I expected when I made the switch. Always improving.
