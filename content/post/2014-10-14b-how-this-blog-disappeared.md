A few days, and a few posts, after setting up this blog, it disappeared. All I did was a distribution update on the system being used as the web server — Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04.

The upgrade appeared to go well. Everything worked as I tested the newly upgraded system — except my blog directory was gone. No explanation. Nothing in the logs. Gone. My domains were pointing to empty space.

The perils of upgrading. And the big software companies wonder why people are so reluctant to fiddle with their old, outdated stuff.
