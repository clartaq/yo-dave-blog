The [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) language is often [cited](https://medium.com/@rgoomar/why-i-think-elm-is-the-future-of-front-end-development-21e9b091fa05#.f9hvq8nf3) as an up-and-comer for web [front end development](https://changelog.com/posts/elm-functional-front-end-development-and-why-you-should-care). I was attracted to it largely because of the compiler's friendly and extremely helpful error messages. It's really attractive in many ways.

But when I started looking at examples, I often found myself thinking things like "_Why is this so inconsistent?_" or "_Why is this syntax so complicated?_". And it finally occurred to me that I've been ruined by the way Clojure/ClojureScript/Lisp/Scheme do things. I can't seem to go back.
