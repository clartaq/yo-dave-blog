For a change, this is **not** a rant; this is an *homage*.

Twenty years ago last week, [Dave Winer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer) started what later came to be called blogging. Dave’s [remembrance](http://scripting.com/2014/10/07/20YearsOfBlogging.html) of the event kind of rambles a bit, but that is his right. That’s what he gave us. Everyone now has the ability to say whatever they want and be read by whomever is interested. At a time when it seems that oppression of many sorts is winning, blogs are a strong statement of freedom. We all owe Dave a big thanks.
