As you may have guessed, I like to fiddle with things until they seem to be just perfect. One of those fiddly things is font pairing. (Changed them just today as a matter of fact.) I can never seem to get the perfect pairing of headline and body fonts.

In order to get a little more professional perspective, I follow the [TypeWolf](https://www.typewolf.com/) blog. [Jeremiah Shoaf](http://www.jeremiahshoaf.com/) is a great design resource. I have even spent actual money to buy his ["The Definitive Guide to Free Fonts"](https://www.typewolf.com/free-fonts), which he updates monthly. I'm too cheap to pay for fonts to use on this small web site, so this is a great resource for me.

If you are interested in typography and design, check out TypeWolf. You won't be sorry.
