Well, Happy New Year everyone.

It seems like I've been hearing a lot of buzz about getting **un**connected. Everything from hotels offering special deals on stays where you are forced to turn off (or turn in) all your gizmos, to advice to disconnect to improve your productivity. Could it be that the pendulum has started to swing in the other direction?

Sit back and enjoy the quiet.
