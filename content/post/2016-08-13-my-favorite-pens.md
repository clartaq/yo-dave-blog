Sure, this is a technology site, but sometimes you have to get a little retro. That is the case for my preferences in note-taking. I tend to do a fair amount of writing into paper notebooks. To do that, I use a pen.

Fountain pens are pretty pieces of art, but too messy and fiddly. Ballpoints are OK, but feel a little harsh as you write. Roller balls are OK too, except the quality of the ink is a bit "smeary" for my tastes. "Felt tip" pens are usually too blunt and "mooshy", but read on...

I've spent a fair amount of time using the [Pilot® Razor Point®](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Razor-Point-Marker-11001/dp/B00006IFJN). They are fiber tipped pens that get very close to being usable and they are relatively inexpensive. However, just like roller balls, they seem a bit smeary.

The perfect pen for me seems to be another fiber tip pen, the [Pigma Micron 03 (0.35mm)](https://www.amazon.com/Sakura-50037-6-Piece-Micron-03-0-35mm/dp/B00K3KRMK8/ref=wl_mb_wl_huc_mrai_2_dp). They move smoothly across most paper and lay down an easy-to-read, permanent, dead-black line. They never smear and work pretty well on flimsy paper. I've never noticed any bleed-through. They come in multiple, well-defined widths and are favorites for drawing as well as writing.

If you're looking for colors in a specific width, purchasing from an [art supply store](http://www.dickblick.com/products/sakura-pigma-micron-pen/) is usually easier than trying to find them on Amazon. They might even be a little cheaper if you get a good deal on shipping.

An almost perfect alternative is the [Sharpie® Pen](https://www.amazon.com/Sharpie-Black-Porous-Point-1744769/dp/B007RTMEX8/ref=sr_1_5?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1471117903&sr=1-5&keywords=sharpie+pens). I can't find any specifics on the line width, but it looks and feels just like the Micron 03. It's barrel is just a little less comfortable in my hand when writing. Otherwise, it would be a tie between these two. As a bonus, they can sometimes be found for a lower price than the Sakuras.

When you just have to put something on paper, these are the way to go.
