New versions of Java come out fairly frequently. On my system, I need to remember to update other settings to use the updates. These include:

*   The JAVA_HOME environment variable
*   The path to the bin directory in the PATH environment variable
*   The "Program Files\Netbeans x.x\etc\netbeans.conf" file (on Windows)
These settings keep everything building and running correctly.
