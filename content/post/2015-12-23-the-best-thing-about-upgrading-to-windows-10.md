Is that it shuts up the continual nagging to upgrade to Windows 10.

I tried to upgrade earlier this year but it was a miserable failure. Buggy, slow, missing device drivers, nosy, nosy, nosy.

It was a bit improved this time. A Windows 10 version of the driver for my Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500 finally appeared, so I thought I would try it again. The upgrade process was pretty smooth and the new driver works just fine.

The only real issue I had was that my Blu-ray/DVD drive disappeared from the list of devices in Device Manager. Couldn’t get to stuff on that drive or save anything new. After looking around for a solution, I had to delete my ATAPI devices from Device Manager and reboot. It found the drive and it’s been working Ok since then.

This install seems to be a lot less buggy and much faster too. I assume it is still as nosy as ever and will have to take steps to deal with that soon.
