The first time I tried to install Windows 10, I had to revert to 7 because the Start Menu started producing Critical Errors.

Naturally, I searched the web for solutions. None worked, including the suggestions made by Microsoft about using a particular sequence of logins, checking system files for corruption, and creating a new user and transferring all my data to the new user account.

Eventually, I came across this [link to a post of possible solutions](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/windows-10-critical-error-start-menu-isnt-working/878cdf28-aae2-4b93-9dbf-aef0bc9ab0ea?auth=1) containing the usual stuff, but someone also mentioned that their system started working correctly once they removed [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/). I found more corroboration in a few other places scattered around the web. As unlikely as it seems, it actually worked for me.

I find it incredible that the folks at both Microsoft and Dropbox seem unaware of this and havenâ€™t fixed it.
